                 Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided
                entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety.

                But what would you have me do? Even if I were, for you, to divest
                myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too
                much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great
                tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can
                with her. Strive to win her. I give you leave to say and do all you
                wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my
                feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it
                myself if necessary.

                Frosine, dear Frosine, will you not help us?

                Indeed, I should like to do so, as you know. I am not naturally
                unkind. Heaven has not given me a heart of flint, and I feel but too
                ready to help when I see young people loving each other in all
                earnestness and honesty. What can we do in this case?
