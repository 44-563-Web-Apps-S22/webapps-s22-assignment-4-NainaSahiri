        <h3>THE MISER. (L'AVARE.)</h3>
        <h5>Act - IV - Conversation is between CLE, MAR, FRO and ELI</h5>
        <p>
            <h6>CLE.</h6> 
            <p>
                Let us come in here; we shall be much better. There is no one
                about us that we need be afraid of, and we can speak openly.
            </p>
            
            <h6>ELI.</h6>
            <p>
                 Yes, Madam, my brother has told me of the love he has for you. I
                know what sorrow and anxiety such trials as these may cause, and I
                assure you that I have the greatest sympathy for you.
            </p>
            
            <h6>MAR.</h6>
            <p>
                I feel it a great comfort in my trouble to have the sympathy of a
                person like you, and I entreat you, Madam, ever to retain for me a
                 so capable of softening the cruelty of my fate.
            </p>
            
            <h6>FRO.</h6>
            <p>
                You really are both very unfortunate not to have told me of all
                this before. I might certainly have warded off the blow, and not have
                carried things so far.
            </p>
            
            <h6>CLE.</h6>
            <p>
                What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.
                But you, fair Marianne, what have you resolved to do? What resolution
                have you taken?
            </p>
            
            <h6>MAR.</h6>
            <p>
                Alas! Is it in my power to take any resolution? And, dependent as
                I am, can I do anything else except form wishes?
            </p>
            
            <h6>CLE.</h6>
            <p>
                No other support for me in your heart? Nothing but mere wishes?
                No pitying energy? No kindly relief? No active affection?
            </p>
            
            <h6>MAR.</h6>
            <p>
                What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what
                I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely
                to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what
                is modest and seemly.
